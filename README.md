# onepiece-bounty-posters
Welcome to the **One Piece Bounty Poster** project! This project showcases a collection of posters of the wanted characters from the **One Piece** universe. It's an open gallery for the fans to view the collection of **One Piece Wanted Posters**, and the users can update the posters by uploading new images. The posters are displayed in descending order of the bounty price, starting from the most valued (Pirate King **Gol D. Roger**) to the least valued (**Bepo** the polar bear). The app is built using Node.js, Express, EJS, and custom styles, and it's designed to bring the world of *One Piece* closer to its fans.

## Current Features
* **Dynamic wanted posters**: View wanted posters from the *One Piece* universe including the bounty posters for marine by *Cross Build*.
* **Update the posters**: You can update the posters like images, names, and bounty by uploading new pictures with the file uploader option.
* **Responsiveness**: The Web Application is **mobile-friendly** so you can have a seamless experience on small screens.
* **Security & Privacy**: Only genuine *One Piece* fans are allowed to edit the posters, therefore we have set up an authentication username and password. To avail of the editor license you have to send an email to <anandanayanofficial@gmail.com>.
